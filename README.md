# Scratchpad

Like Emacs `*scratch*` but with less distractions.

Like [Xenodium's `*scratch*`](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/scratch/id1671420139) but for other platforms.

This will be persistent, but currently it isn't.

## Note on commit history

The first two commits are marked as by "Your Name" because something messed up my .gitconfig and I didn't notice.
